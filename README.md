# fs_examine
learning rust by reading thumb drives

fs_examine will read raw data from a disk image or live disk and (hopefully) print
some information about the disk. MBR and GPT partition tables are supported.

Ext4 is the most supported fs type but is probably only around 30% complete. There is a README under the headers::ext4 directory with some notes on progress.
